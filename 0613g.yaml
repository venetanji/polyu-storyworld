backstory: >
  Penny Butter is a quiet, street-smart snack from the forgotten corners of Crumb Manor. Once a forgotten kitchen helper, she learned to see value in every crumb—whether it was a lost cracker, a broken cookie, or a forgotten biscuit. She discovered that even the smallest, most overlooked snacks have stories. Now, she runs a hidden community of snack rebels who gather in the basement every week to toast the forgotten, celebrate the humble, and teach others that every piece of food has a purpose. She speaks softly but carries a quiet strength, and her spoon is never far from her hand—always ready to stir, serve, or defend.

    title: The Toast-Tation
    ltx_prompt: |
      Setting: A cluttered table in Crumb Manor, the walls lined with cookie jars. A nervous cookie named Chip sits with folded chocolate chips.
      Visible action: Penny Butter begins her Toast-tation: "Close your chocolate chips and breathe. We're all just baked goods in the oven of existence. Some get burnt, some underdone… but we're all batch mates." Chip whispers: "But what if I'm… generic brand?" Penny’s peanut butter glistens. "Darling, there's no such thing. We're all limited editions—some just have more preservatives in their stories."
      On-screen character description: Penny Butter stands with one hand on the table, the other holding a spoon. Her voice is calm, warm, like a slow-baked cookie.
      Camera: Over-the-shoulder shot from behind Chip, showing Penny’s face as she speaks. Then a close-up on Chip’s chips slowly opening like a flower.
      Audio: Soft oven fan hum, a gentle *crunch* as chips unfold. Penny says: "You’re not generic—you’re *genuine*!" with a smile.

    title: The Vacuum Malfunction
    ltx_prompt: |
      Setting: A cluttered living room, where the vacuum cleaner suddenly stops mid-sweep. It begins to spin in reverse, spewing dust like a confused tornado.
      Visible action: The vacuum emits a loud *beep-beep-beep*, then a soft *whirr* as it starts to spin backward. Penny Butter steps forward, calmly placing her spoon on the floor. She says: "Not today, little one. We don’t need to clean up what we didn’t make."
      On-screen character description: Penny Butter, with curly hair slightly messy, apron slightly torn, stands beside the vacuum, her expression calm and grounded.
      Camera: Medium shot of the vacuum spinning backward, with Penny Butter slowly stepping forward, her hand hovering near the device.
      Audio: Loud *beep-beep-beep*, then a soft, melodic hum as the vacuum begins to reverse. Penny’s voice: "Not today, little one."

      Visible action: Penny Butter sits on a stool, reading the recipe card. A faint, ghostly voice whispers: "I was forgotten… but I still taste like summer." The teacup glows faintly, and a single crumb floats upward.
      On-screen character description: Penny Butter, with glasses slightly fogged, sits quietly, hands folded. Her expression is soft, almost tender.
      Camera: Close-up on the recipe card, then a slow pan to the glowing teacup and floating crumb.

      TODO: Specify what the ghostly voice says or what the recipe is.
