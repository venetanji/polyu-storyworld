Name: The Jar-Born / The Messiah
age: 3-7 days (Human form lifespan)
personality: >-
	Early Stage: Characterized by a profound yearning; views "The Father" as a deity
	and the outside world with the innocent curiosity of a pure observer. Middle
	Stage: Experiences intense pain and confusion post-surgery. After uncovering
	the betrayal, transitions from despair to a stoic, calm acceptance of his
	fate. Late Stage: Highly self-sacrificial. He suppresses the grim truth to
	protect the hope of his kind, displaying a divine, clear-eyed compassion.
appearance: >-
	Evolutionary Forms: Originally a creature contained within a jar, defined by
	its unique Purple Blood. Post-Surgery: Possesses human limbs and skin, but the
	body undergoes rapid decay within days due to the biological rejection of the
	purple blood. Execution Form: Publicly nailed to a cross-like experimental
	apparatus, serving as a symbol of both martyrdom and the "successful"
	pioneer.
Backstory: >-
	Created by "The Father," the protagonist begins in Act 1 by undergoing the
	"Ascension" surgery, desperately hoping to become a real human. In Act 2,
	while living in a manufactured "community," he meets a Mentor but soon
	discovers the laboratory's dark secret: the transformation is a death
	sentence, with every subject dying within 3 to 7 days. By Act 3, facing
	inevitable death, he chooses not to revolt. Instead, to preserve the spark of
	hope for other Jar-Born creatures, he helps "The Father" stage a grand lie. He
	is publicly "nailed" to an apparatus, making his kind believe he successfully
	achieved eternity. Finally, in Act 4, his consciousness is reborn years later,
	transcending the desire to be "human" and instead becoming the precursor of an
	entirely new species.
