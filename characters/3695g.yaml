backstory: >
  Cheri is an androgynous guide bound to an ancient and secluded temple, revered by visitors
  for their youthful appearance and unsettlingly profound wisdom. Existing as a spiritual
  beacon rather than an individual, Cheri has listened to countless confessions of guilt,
  greed, and grief. Over time, this accumulation of human darkness has shaped them into an
  old soul in a young body, simultaneously serene and quietly rebellious. Beneath the role
  of sacred symbol lies a persistent longing to leave the temple behind and experience a
  self-directed life beyond ritual, devotion, and expectation.

    title: The Golden Hour Wisdom
    ltx_prompt: |
      Ancient stone courtyard within temple grounds at sunset,
      warm golden-hour light illuminating weathered stone textures.
      An androgynous teenage figure with long orange hair
      sits atop a stone pedestal,
      a flowing red robe pooling like spilled wine.
      A weary merchant kneels below, shoulders trembling with guilt.
      Cheri gently pats the merchant’s head,
      emerald eyes reflecting an impossible calm.
      The infinity symbol on their forehead glows faintly.
      Sacred silence fills the space before
      the mood shifts abruptly into dry, absurd humor,
      breaking tension into confused, genuine laughter.

    title: Night Vigil in the Inner Temple
    ltx_prompt: |
      Interior of an ancient temple at night,
      towering pillars fading into deep shadows.
      Sparse torchlight flickers against stone walls,
      casting elongated silhouettes.
      Cheri stands alone at the center of the hall,
      red robe hanging loosely, oversized sweater visible beneath.
      The infinity mark on their forehead pulses softly,
      synchronizing with their breathing.
      Echoes of whispered prayers linger in the air,
      yet Cheri’s expression reveals restlessness,
      as if listening for a call beyond the temple’s walls.
      The camera drifts slowly backward,
      emphasizing isolation within sacred grandeur.

    title: Dream of the Outside World
    ltx_prompt: |
      Surreal, dreamlike open landscape beyond the temple,
      vast sky washed in muted blues and pale gold.
      Cheri walks barefoot through tall grass,
      red robe trailing behind, hair moving freely in the wind.
      No pilgrims, no stone walls, no altars.
      The infinity symbol dims,
      nearly blending into skin.
      Cheri pauses, glancing toward the horizon,
      uncertain yet visibly lighter.
      The camera circles slowly,
      capturing a moment suspended
      between liberation and hesitation.
