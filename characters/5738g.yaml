backstory: >
  Captain Quick (born as an abandoned orphan) was raised by a dedicated firefighter adoptive father.
  Lacking companionship, Quick grew up rebellious. A childhood prank with fire turned tragic, killing his father who died saving him.
  The scar on his brow is a permanent reminder. To atone, he became a firefighter relying on agility and Dr. Goat's potions (Strength/Speed/Jump).
  He acts outwardly sunny and cocky ("Catch me if you can!"), but is internally driven by guilt.
  Now a celebrated "City Hero," he has recently discovered a clue about his biological parents, pulling him into a conspiracy.
