      title: "The Midnight Tag"
      description: |
        Luna sneaks out of her dorm room at 2 AM, hood pulled over her silver hair. She navigates through dark alleyways until she reaches her canvas - an old brick wall in an abandoned warehouse district. With spray cans in hand, she creates a vibrant mural representing student struggles. Just as she finishes her signature, police sirens echo in the distance. She escapes through a narrow passage, heart pounding, adrenaline rushing through her veins.

  - scene_2:
      title: "Lecture Rebellion"
      description: |
        In a packed lecture hall, a professor drones on about 'following industry standards.' Luna sits in the front row, not taking notes, but sketching furiously. When the professor notices and calls her out, she stands up, holds up her sketch - a creative interpretation of the topic - and challenges the entire class: "Why are we learning to copy when we could learn to create?" The room goes silent, then erupts in whispers. Some students nod in agreement.

  - scene_3:
      title: "The Rooftop Revelation"
      description: |
        Luna sits on the university rooftop at sunset, her sketchbook open. She's been struggling with her identity - balancing her love for art against family pressure to be 'practical.' A stranger approaches - an elderly man who turns out to be a former street artist who gave up his passion. They share stories as the sun sets over the campus. Luna realizes her art isn't just rebellion - it's her way of connecting with others and making people think differently. She tears out the page, hands it to him: "This is for you. Don't give up."
