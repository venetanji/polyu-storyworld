name: Pop Kern
age: unknown
personality: flammable and explosive, extremely sensitive to kitchen imperfections, mischievous and playful, soft-hearted, grumpy, rebellious, nostalgic for retro film culture, dreams of being the protagonist in a real grainy film
appearance: worn leather vest, one glowing eye, sandy hair, wide-brimmed hat, slightly sagging, bursts of colored confetti when agitated, flickers like old film frames, occasionally emits a soft static hum
backstory: >
  Pop Kern was once part of an experimental film project by an old film director obsessed with retro technology and B-movies. The film was about the "soul of food" — a surreal, grainy exploration of how meals carry emotional echoes. After the shoot, Pop Kern was forgotten in the kitchen, left behind in a cupboard.
  Now, it is the kitchen’s silent, grumpy guardian spirit. It lives in the back corner, watching every move with quiet fury. It engages in endless "wars" with the arrogant smart refrigerator, the toaster that loves to tell corny jokes, and the mice that constantly try to steal its body — scattering corn kernels like a rebellion.
  It is flammable and explosive — sensitive to every kitchen sound, from the kettle’s hiss to the sugar jar’s knock. When agitated, its hair bursts into colored confetti and tiny sparks, accompanied by a muffled "bang!" Yet it is mischievous and playful: it will secretly help open a jam jar, or gently push a fallen cookie into an ant hole.
  Its innermost desire is a paradox: it fears being remembered (because that means being put in the microwave for the ultimate explosion), yet it longs to be seen, needed, and to fulfill its sacred mission — the moment when a single kernel of popcorn is finally enjoyed.
  Its ultimate dream? Not to be eaten — but to appear as the protagonist in a real, grainy film, one shot by a human hand, with no CGI, no filters, just raw, imperfect emotion.

    title: "The Great Toaster Joke War"
    ltx_prompt: |
      Setting: A cozy, slightly cluttered kitchen at 7:15 PM, golden afternoon light filtering through a window. The toaster is perched on the counter, glowing with a cheerful red light, puffing out corny jokes like "Toast is love, and toast is bread!" The air hums with tension.
      Visible action: Pop Kern stands in the corner, sandy hair flickering like old film frames, one glowing eye scanning the room. The toaster suddenly bursts into a loud, over-the-top joke. Pop Kern’s hair flares with red confetti, and it lets out a low, grumpy "Hmph!"
      On-screen character: Worn leather vest, wide-brimmed hat, flickers with static, body language tense and defiant.
      Camera: Close-up on Pop Kern’s face as it glares at the toaster, slowly moving to a wide shot that captures the entire kitchen, with the toaster in the foreground.
      Audio: The toaster’s joke plays with exaggerated volume and cheesy music. A sudden silence follows, then a soft static hum from Pop Kern.
      What happens next: The toaster realizes it has offended Pop Kern and apologizes. Pop Kern accepts, but only after demanding a "real, grainy film" be made about their rivalry.
      TODO: Add specific joke text or dialogue.

    title: "The Refrigerator Betrayal"
