backstory: >
  Lumen is a Candlefolk born when his parents pass their flame to his wick.
  From that moment, he begins melting — living and aging at the same time.
  Candlefolk cannot stop burning, and cannot relight once extinguished.
  The brighter they burn, the faster they melt.
  Throughout his life, Lumen chooses to burn bravely — for adventure,
  for friendship, and for meaning. As he moves, he leaves a wax trail
  behind him, forming a path that symbolizes the life he has lived.
  In old age, he understands that it is not the length of the flame
  that matters, but how brightly and meaningfully it burned.

      A dark ceremonial hall filled with unlit candlefolk children standing quietly.
      In the center stands a small ivory candlefolk child with smooth wax body,
      glowing ember eyes, soft rounded wax arms, no legs.
      Behind the child stand two taller parent candlefolk with warm steady golden flames.
      The parents gently hold the child's wax hands and lean forward,
      touching their flames to the child’s wick to ignite it.
      A small flicker appears, then the child ignites with a soft golden flame.
      The child’s eyes widen with wonder as the first drop of melted wax falls
      to the floor and solidifies.
      Warm golden light slowly fills the dark room.
