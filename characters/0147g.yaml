backstory: Varney was built in a forgotten lab beneath an old city. It was designed to observe and protect, not to speak. Its only form of communication is through its horns — subtle pulses, rhythmic vibrations, or sudden bright flashes. Over time, it learned to interpret human emotions through environmental cues and developed a quiet sense of loyalty to what remains — schools, monuments, memories. It believes that what is left behind is more valuable than what is built. It does not speak, but its horns glow in response to emotions it senses.
