background: "After seeing a local street lifting competition, Eldric felt a pang of regret for a life spent hunched over watches. He attempted a pull-up and threw out his back. That night, in a pain-killer induced haze, he drifted not into sleep, but into the Grand Hall of the Aetherial Academy. There, he isn't learning to make clocks; he's learning that weight is relative. Upon waking, he found his coffee mug floating an inch off the table."
