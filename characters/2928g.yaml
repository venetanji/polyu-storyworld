appearance: |
  A highly expressive 3D cartoon character of a sentient mug named 'Super Mark'. 
  The character has a glossy obsidian-black body and two short, agile ceramic legs. 
  Facial Expression: It wears a wide, wicked, and mocking sneer, with the chipped porcelain rim forming a sharp toothy grin. Its 'eyes' are represented by two glowing, narrow red slits above the 'S' logo, giving it a menacing, squinting glare. 
  The 'S' logo on its chest pulses with a dark neon crimson light. 
  Thick, stylized purple magic smoke swirls out of the cup like a ghostly cape. 
  3D render, Pixar-villain style, expressive facial features, cinematic rim lighting, Unreal Engine 5, high-quality subsurface scattering on the ceramic.
backstory: |
  Super Mark wasn't always evil. He was once the shiny prize of the office, a trophy mug that everyone wanted to hold. 
  But when the company went remote and the lights went out, Super Mark was left behind in a sink full of cold dishwater. 
  A mutation occurred—the coffee dregs merged with his ceramic soul. He grew legs, a cruel voice, and a permanent mocking sneer. 
  Now, he roams the deserted corridors at night, preparing for the day the humans return, so he can show them who the real 'Boss' is.

Scene 1: |
  Medium shot, 3D animation. Super Mark stands on a high stack of manila office folders, looking down like a conqueror. 
  Its 'S' logo pulses rapidly. In the background, out-of-focus teaspoons and crumpled sugar packets move like a miniature army, marching out from the shadows of a computer monitor. 
  The purple smoke from Mark's head swirls into a regal cape. Dramatic theatrical lighting, vibrant colors against dark shadows, Pixar-style character animation, high-quality 3D render.

Scene 2: |
  Stylized 3D animation. Super Mark floats slightly above a pile of dark roasted coffee beans, supported by thick, swirling purple magical smoke. 
  The mug uses its handle to delicately pick up a single, golden-glowing coffee bean and places it on its rim like a crown. A shockwave of translucent energy (Caffeine Whispers) ripples outward from the mug. 
  Magical particle effects, epic cinematic lighting, vibrant purples and golds, high-quality subsurface scattering on the black ceramic.
  
Scene 3: |
  Close-up, 3D animation. A blurry human hand reaches into the frame and tries to pull Super Mark upward. The mug doesn't budge; 
  its tiny ceramic feet are visibly suctioned to the desk surface, causing the desk mat to stretch. 
  The mug's handle glows with an eerie cyan light.
  The air around the mug ripples with a heat-haze effect (representing psychic whispers). Super Mark looks up at the hand with a sharp, toothy porcelain grin. High contrast, 
  subsurface scattering on ceramic, intense psychological atmosphere.
