name: "Super Mark"
personality: "Grandiosity", "Antisocial", "Machiavellian"
appearance: |
  A highly expressive 3D cartoon character of a sentient mug named 'Super Mark'. 
  The character has a glossy obsidian-black body and two short, agile ceramic legs. 
  Facial Expression: It wears a wide, wicked, and mocking sneer, with the chipped porcelain rim forming a sharp toothy grin. Its 'eyes' are represented by two glowing, narrow red slits above the 'S' logo, giving it a menacing, squinting glare. 
  The 'S' logo on its chest pulses with a dark neon crimson light. 
  Thick, stylized purple magic smoke swirls out of the cup like a ghostly cape. 
  3D render, Pixar-villain style, expressive facial features, cinematic rim lighting, Unreal Engine 5, high-quality subsurface scattering on the ceramic.
backstory: |
  Super Mark wasn't always evil. He was once the shiny prize of the office, a trophy mug that everyone wanted to hold. 
  But when the company went remote and the lights went out, Super Mark was left behind in a sink full of cold dishwater. 
  A mutation occurred—the coffee dregs merged with his ceramic soul. He grew legs, a cruel voice, and a permanent mocking sneer. 
  Now, he roams the deserted corridors at night, preparing for the day the humans return, so he can show them who the real 'Boss' is.
