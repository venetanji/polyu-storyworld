story_hook: >
  Nick has noticed a bizarre phenomenon: whenever Mia starts an
  argument with him,  she suddenly vanishes into thin air, only to reappear the
  next day.  While eerie, Nick has grown to enjoy the peace and quiet it
  brings,  choosing to ignore the supernatural implications in favor of more
  gaming time.
scenes:
  scene1: >
    At home. Nick is gaming through the night, his face illuminated  only by
    the screen. He is so deeply immersed that he fails to  notice Mia standing
    behind him, watching with a look of pure  disappointment before silently
    closing the door.
  scene2: >
    In a restaurant. Mia is talking excitedly about her day, but  Nick’s
    eyes are glued to a mobile game under the table. Frustrated  by his lack of
    attention, Mia suddenly slams her hand on the  table, startling the nearby
    diners.
  scene3: >
    At home. Nick is gaming again. Mia rushes toward him, her face  flushed
    with anger, ready to start an argument. But the next  second, she vanishes
    into thin air mid-sentence. Nick freezes,  his eyes widening in shock as he
    stares at the empty space  where she just stood.
