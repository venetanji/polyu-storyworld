Scenes:
1. Subject: Shaw, a cute petite Asian girl with long black hair and round glasses, sitting cross-legged on the floor in the center of the frame. 
She is wearing an oversized pastel hoodie and holding a game controller. 
Environment: A very tiny, cluttered bedroom seen from a high-angle, top-down perspective using a fisheye lens effect to exaggerate the cramped coziness. 
The floor is barely visible, covered in piles of manga comic books, scattered plush dolls (cats and anime characters), colorful dresses thrown over a chair, and tangled wires connecting various retro and modern game consoles (Switch, PlayStation, etc.). 
Lighting & Atmosphere: Warm, ambient lighting coming from the glow of multiple computer monitors and fairy lights strung on the walls. 
The atmosphere is messy, lived-in, and intimate. 
Details: A half-eaten bag of chips near her knee, posters of anime characters on the walls, shelves overflowing with figurines. 
She looks up toward the camera with a slightly surprised, innocent expression, like a deer caught in headlights.

2. Subject: Shaw sitting casually on a low concrete seawall, legs dangling. 
She is smiling genuinely and brightly, eyes crinkled in joy (without glasses for this shot, or holding them in her hand), looking incredibly pretty and soft. 
The wind is blowing her long black hair across her face slightly. 
She is wearing a light, airy white sundress with a blue cardigan slipping off one shoulder. 
Environment: A beautiful seaside promenade on a bright sunny day. 
The background is filled with a vast, sparkling deep blue ocean meeting a clear azure sky. 
A few white seagulls are flying in the distance or perched nearby on the wall. 
Lighting & Atmosphere: High-key lighting, overexposed sunlight creating a dreamy, ethereal "Japanese film photography" look. 
The colors are vibrant—deep blues, bright whites, and soft skin tones. 
Details: A refreshing, cool breeze is visually implied by the movement of her hair and dress. 
The scene feels nostalgic, like a memory of a summer vacation. She looks tiny against the vast ocean, emphasizing her petite stature.

3. Subject: Shaw standing in front of a large mirror in a school restroom. 
She is leaning slightly forward, checking her reflection. 
She wears large, bulky over-ear headphones around her neck and is blowing a small pink bubble with bubble gum. 
She wears a slightly loose university uniform or casual campus wear (pleated skirt and cardigan). 
Environment: An old-fashioned school restroom with a somewhat sterile, nostalgic vibe. Walls are covered in small, clinical white tiles. 
There are white porcelain washbasins and silver faucets. 
The mirror is slightly tarnished at the edges. 
Lighting & Atmosphere: Cold, harsh fluorescent white light buzzing overhead, casting slight shadows under her eyes. 
The color palette is desaturated blues, whites, and grays, contrasting with her black hair and pink bubble gum. 
Camera/Style: Eye-level shot, focusing on her reflection in the mirror. The mood is quiet, detached, and cinematic. 
She looks bored but secretly nervous, perhaps hiding here to recharge her social battery.
