Background Story: 
In 1997, it was manufactured in a factory in Canada. During the final production inspection, a tragic accident occurred — 
the hood of this red Buick Century suddenly slammed shut and crushed a worker who tried to smoke on it to death. Despite 
the incident, the unethical factory still shipped the vehicle to Desert Center, California, in the United States.
There, the car lived a quiet and uneventful life for some time, until it was stolen by a Mexican gang and taken to
Los Angeles. That very night, the car developed full self-awareness. It massacred the entire car-theft crew and was 
ubsequently pursued by the Los Angeles police. In the end, it escaped by disguising and transforming into a similar
vehicle model. It then boarded an ocean-going cargo ship bound for China, eventually arriving at Yantai Port in 
Shandong Province.
