backstory: >
  Ten years ago, during a catastrophic disaster, Huan was separated from his family. To find them, he embarked on a long and solitary journey. He traveled tirelessly across different cities and countries, searching for news of his loved ones while earning commissions through the combat skills he had honed over the years. During one mission, Huan faced overwhelming odds against a formidable foe. Cornered, he made a pact with a demon, trading a portion of his soul for immense power—the ability to command demonic flames. Now, his spirit is tormented, yet his unwavering resolve to find his family drives him forward.
