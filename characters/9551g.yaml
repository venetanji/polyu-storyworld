name: Johnny
age: 28
personality: stage maniac, lazy in private, fiercely loyal
appearance: >
	Silver-gray wolf-dog features crown a human frame built for spectacle, and a
	polished mechanical left eye flickers beneath a black tactical hood. He moves
	with stage-drill precision in matte armor, the only color coming from neon LED
	accents running along his gear.
backstory: >
	Born beneath the smog domes of Kowloon Arcology, Johnny was raised by the pit
	crews of an outlaw racing syndicate. The mechanics taught him to tune engines
	and patch cybernetics, replacing his shattered left eye with a spare drone lens
	after a crash he barely survived. Onstage he channels the roar of those tunnels
	into feral performances that keep corporate sponsors wary and underground fans
	obsessed. Offstage he naps anywhere he can drop his gear, saving his energy for
	the few people he swore to protect.
