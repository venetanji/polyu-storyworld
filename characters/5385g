name: Seon
age:93
Personality: Seon is calm, determined, and introspective. He is a man of few words, guided by patience and unwavering resolve. Beneath his quiet nature lies a deep emotional wound that shaped his entire life. He is not driven by obsession, but by a promise he refuses to abandon.
appearance: Seon is a thin, elderly man with a slightly curved posture and weathered hands marked by time. He wears old but carefully kept clothes and slightly crooked glasses. His movements are slow yet deliberate. His eyes carry both sadness and warmth, and he often sits near the doorway, as if waiting for someone who never arrived.
backstory: As a child, Seon was separated from his mother during a chaotic moment at the harbor. She told him to wait by a marked mooring post — and he did, for days. She never returned. As the city changed and the coastline disappeared beneath modern construction, Seon realized he had not only lost a person, but a place tied to love and belonging. This unresolved trauma shaped his life. He opened the Eternal Store near the old shoreline and began documenting fragments of the past, believing that by reconstructing lost memories he could rediscover what had once connected him to his mother. His life became a quiet mission: to prove that what is truly important is never completely lost.
aspirations: To find the lost anchor point, reconstruct the vanished coastline, preserve memory, and ensure that emotional bonds are not erased by time. His deepest aspiration is to keep a promise — to not abandon the past, and to transform loss into continuity.
Strengths: Unwavering determination, emotional endurance, patience, symbolic vision, ability to give meaning to ordinary objects, strong sense of purpose, resilience shaped by trauma, capacity to create stability even in loss.
Weaknesses: Unable to fully let go of the past, emotionally solitary, carries unresolved trauma, life shaped by waiting rather than living, his mission depends on something that may no longer exist, vulnerability hidden beneath calm strength.
