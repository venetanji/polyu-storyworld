# Three Defining Scenes

Scene Title: Counter Coexistence  
  Description
    Afternoon sunlight filters through the carved window lattice. Reddington curls up asleep on the rosewood counter, his whiskers twitching slightly with each breath.  
    The tip of his tail rests gently on the ceramic "Lucky Cat" forever waving its paw beside him—one real, one ceramic; one still, one perpetually in motion.  

Scene Title: Watching Rain from the Eaves  
  Description
    After closing late at night, a light rain drizzles down. Reddington leaps onto the glazed-tile roof eaves and lies there quietly,  
    his amber pupils reflecting the wet neon signs and occasional passerby in the distance.  

Scene Title: Guardian of the Threshold  
  Description
    One early morning, Reddington sits upright in the center of the doorstep,  
    an old accounting brush held in his mouth and his fluffy tail coiled neatly in front of him.  
    His solemn posture resembles that of a stone lion—a feline guardian bringing protection and auspicious energy to the shop.
