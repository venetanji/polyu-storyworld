gender: "male"

personality:
  - protective
  - stoic
  - vigilant
  - quietly loyal
  - independent

appearance: |
  A realistic brown-orange tabby cat with a lean adult build.
  He has a clear, symmetrical M-shaped marking on his forehead and a noticeable warm off-white patch on his chest.
  His coat shows classic tabby striping in muted, sun-worn tones rather than bright ginger.
  Gruu has a slightly narrow face, long uneven whiskers, and yellow-green eyes; one eye shows subtle signs of an old injury under certain lighting.
  He is most often seen wearing black retro sunglasses that fully obscure his eyes.
  Naturalistic proportions, restrained expression, street photography realism.

backstory: |
  Gruu grew up as a stray and was injured in one eye during his time on the streets.
  The injury left him sensitive to strong light and glare.
  He was later taken in by an elderly man, who offered him shelter and personally placed a pair of black sunglasses onto his face to protect the injured eye.
  As Gruu grew older, he became a quiet but respected presence in the neighborhood, informally patrolling the streets at night.
  When the old man fell ill, Gruu remained as his sole companion and caretaker.
