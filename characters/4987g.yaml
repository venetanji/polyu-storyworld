name: Yoichi 
age: 17
personality: >
  Extremely competitive and ego-driven on the pitch. Normally polite, humble, and team-oriented off the field, but becomes intensely focused, provocative, and ruthless during matches to win at all costs. Highly analytical, quick to adapt, reads the field exceptionally well (spatial awareness / Metavision), and continuously evolves.
appearance: >
  Japanese high-school footballer, 175 cm tall, athletic lean build. Dark blue short hair, sharp intense blue eyes that glow in "flow" state. Often wears Blue Lock #11 uniform (white/blue tracksuit or kit), casual streetwear off-field.
backstory: >
  Former ace striker of Ichinan High School. In the prefectural final, he passed instead of shooting due to "team play" values and regretted it deeply when the chance was lost. Invited to Blue Lock (started rank 299), discovered his weapon — exceptional field vision and adaptability — and evolved into a direct-shooting egoist striker who can predict and dominate plays.
