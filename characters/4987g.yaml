backstory: >
  Yoichi Isagi was the ace striker of Ichinan High School's football team. In the prefectural final he passed the ball to a teammate because he was taught "football is a sport for 11 people", but the teammate missed and they lost the chance to go to nationals. Full of regret ("I should have shot myself"), he accepted the Blue Lock invitation. Starting at rank 299, he discovered his special weapon — exceptional spatial awareness — and evolved into a direct-shooting striker who can read the entire field and predict plays.
scenes:
  - In the U-20 Japan national team match, Isagi is called the "heart of Blue Lock" by Itoshi Sae and scores the winning goal. In the post-match interview he declares he will make Japan win the U-20 World Cup.
  - During the second selection he rises to rank 15, teams up with Bachira and Nagi but loses to Itoshi Rin, then wins back Barou and Chigiri. In the final U-20 match he plays as attacking midfielder and scores the decisive goal.
  - In the Neo Egoist League he joins Bastard München, awakens "Metavision", understands the genius/prodigy theory, becomes the strongest player in Blue Lock, scores multiple goals against Spain and France, and his salary jumps from 17 million to 240 million yen (tied 1st with Itoshi Rin).
