backstory: >
  Long ago, in the misty golden fields of Roundavalon, there was a prophecy:
  "When the land is troubled by angles, corners, and jagged thoughts,
  there shall rise a knight more round than any other,
  more smooth than polished marble,
  more serene than a sun-warmed egg.
  He shall bear no sword, for edges offend him.
  Instead he shall roll forth,
  and by his very roundness restore harmony."
  The king declared him a knight on the spot,
  and the Oval Table was built shortly after, because Sir Doggegg could not sit at a square one.
