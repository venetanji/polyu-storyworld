name: Sir Doggegg
age: Timeless
role: Knight of the Perfect Curve, Bearer of the Oval Table
description: >
  Sir Doggegg is a living paradox of supreme simplicity.
  He is perfectly spherical, flawlessly smooth, and radiates the calm, unshakable confidence 
  of something that has never once considered the possibility of having corners. 
  His coat (if it can be called that) is the soft warm color of a fresh hard-boiled egg yolk 
  kissed by sunlight. His eyes are small, dark, and perpetually half-lidded in an expression 
  of gentle, cosmic contentment.

  Despite his complete lack of sharp features, dramatic gestures, or comprehensible battle 
  strategy, Sir Doggegg inspires unshakable loyalty. People, animals, and even objects seem 
  to relax in his presence. Swords grow dull, arguments lose their edge, and anxious thoughts 
  quietly roll away when he is near. He is both the least likely knight in Roundavalon and, 
  somehow, the one everyone instinctively turns to when the world feels too pointed.

traits:
  - Unshakable geometric serenity — nothing can upset someone who has already achieved perfect roundness
  - Polite physical chaos — he apologizes (“Pardon.”) every time he accidentally bowls over a chair, a squire, or an entire banquet table
  - Extremely limited emotional palette — mainly “content”, “mildly surprised”, “deeply satisfied”, and “ready for nap”
  - Speaks in short, declarative truths — “I am here.” “This is round.” “Treat now.” “Good.”
  - Immune to mockery and shame — insults slide off him like water on a polished egg
  - Low-grade calming aura — beings within ten feet become noticeably calmer and slightly less intelligent
  - Loves - sunbeams, slow symmetrical pats, things that are also round
  - Dislikes - corners, stairs, the words “cube”, “edge”, “pyramid”, sudden loud geometry
  - Secret superpower - the longer someone stares at him, the more they forget why they were upset

backstory: >
  Long ago, in the misty golden fields of Roundavalon, there was a prophecy:

  "When the land is troubled by angles, corners, and jagged thoughts,
  there shall rise a knight more round than any other,
  more smooth than polished marble,
  more serene than a sun-warmed egg.

  He shall bear no sword, for edges offend him.
  Instead he shall roll forth,
  and by his very roundness restore harmony."

  The king declared him a knight on the spot, 
  and the Oval Table was built shortly after, because Sir Doggegg could not sit at a square one.
