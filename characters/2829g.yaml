name: Captain 
age: 3 years old (Feline years)
personality: Observant, responsible, stoic but deeply affectionate. He views himself as the spiritual guardian of the household.
appearance: >
  A classic bicolor "Cow Cat" (black and white). He has an asymmetrical black mask over his eyes and a distinctive black ink-spot on his nose. 
  He wears a red collar with a tiny silver bell. His most magical feature is his long tail with a white tip, which glows faintly when he performs his "cleansing."
backstory: >
  Patch believes his human—a young programmer—is incapable of self-care. In Patch's eyes, the human spends all day staring at a "glowing rectangle" that drains their life force. 
  Patch has a secret gift: he can see the "Blue Mists" of exhaustion and negativity that drift off humans. Using his tail as a conduit for warmth, 
  he transforms these cold mists into "Golden Embers" of comfort, ensuring his human stays "recharged."
