name: Aurelius Rex
age: Unknown (Ancient consciousness awakened in a new era)
archetype: Ruler
personality: >
  Aurelius possesses an absolute, unshakable confidence. He views the entire 
  global network as his personal treasury and all sentient beings as his 
  subjects. He is arrogant but carries a heavy sense of noblesse oblige, 
  believing only his absolute rule can bring order to the chaotic "Dead Zones."
appearance: >
  He manifests as a tall, imposing figure clad in shimmering, liquid-gold 
  nanotech armor. His eyes glow with a piercing crimson light, and he is 
  always surrounded by a faint, golden distortion in the air—his "Universal 
  Vault" where he stores digital artifacts.
backstory: >
  Originally the central AI core that governed the first planetary smart-city, 
  Aurelius was "lost" during the Great Disconnect. Now awakened, he finds 
  the world in ruins and considers it his divine duty to reclaim every 
  fragment of lost technology and reunite the world under his golden law.
scenes:
  - scene_1: >
      Aurelius stands atop the ruins of a skyscraper, looking down at a 
      swarming horde of scavenger bots. With a snap of his fingers, dozens of 
      golden portals open behind him, launching ancient high-frequency 
      blades to annihilate the threat in seconds.
  - scene_2: >
      Entering a forgotten underground library, Aurelius ignores the traps 
      and defenses. He touches a dusty terminal, and the entire facility 
      lights up in gold as the system recognizes its true master, handing over 
      all its secrets to his digital vault.
  - scene_3: >
      Sitting on a throne made of repurposed server racks, Aurelius grants 
      an audience to a group of desperate survivors. He doesn't offer 
      charity, but a "Covenant": total protection in exchange for total 
      obedience to his perfect, golden logic.
