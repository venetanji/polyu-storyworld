name: Noz
age: 8
species: Brown House Mouse
personality: >
  Quiet and introverted, with a delicate mind. He dislikes crowds and is a bit sensitive and withdrawn. Instead of sneaking food or moving supplies with other mice, he prefers to immerse himself in music alone. Gentle yet persistent, he sticks to playing the guitar even when misunderstood, and deep down, he believes music can bring warmth.
appearance: >
  Covered in short warm brown fur, with a light beige belly. His ears are round, and his eyes are like small shiny black beads, always calm and quiet. His small paws are surprisingly dexterous, clutching a mini guitar made from old strings, small wooden pieces, and bottle caps (later replaced by a tiny real guitar). His tail sways gently to the rhythm unconsciously.
backstory: >
  Noz has lived in the attic of a human house since he was a child. He’s always been drawn to the faint sounds of music coming from the spare room downstairs, a curiosity that made him an outcast among the other attic mice who only cared about survival. His world changed when he discovered the power of music—and a tiny guitar that would become his most precious possession.
key_scenes:
  - Peeks through a gap in the floorboards of the spare room, watching the human owner play an acoustic guitar late at night; 
  he is completely mesmerized by the melodies, pressing his ear to the wood to catch every note, forgetting to return to the attic until dawn
  - Finds a hand-carved tiny toy guitar (left by the human’s child years ago) hidden in a dusty attic shoebox, tucked between old books—he carries it back to his nest, overjoyed, and polishes it for hours with his soft fur
  - Plays the tiny guitar for the first time in his hidden attic corner at moonlight, his shaky but earnest melodies floating through the dust motes;
  he doesn’t notice a few young mice lingering nearby, drawn to the unfamiliar but soothing sound
  - Is confronted by the attic’s lead mouse Grip, who demands he stop "fooling around" and help hoard winter grain; 
  Noz refuses, choosing to protect his guitar even if it means being excluded from the mouse colony
  - The human owner, noticing small paw prints near the shoebox and hearing faint music from the attic, leaves a bowl of sunflower seeds and a spool of soft string (for guitar repairs) on the attic floor—Noz finds them, and for the first time, he plays his guitar not in secret, but with quiet confidence.
