name: Noz
age: 8
personality: >
  Quiet and introverted, with a delicate mind. He dislikes crowds and is a bit sensitive and withdrawn. Instead of sneaking food or moving supplies with other mice, he prefers to immerse himself in music alone. Gentle yet persistent, he sticks to playing the guitar even when misunderstood, and deep down, he believes music can bring warmth.
appearance: >
  Covered in short warm brown fur, with a light beige belly. His ears are round, and his eyes are like small shiny black beads, always calm and quiet. His small paws are surprisingly dexterous, clutching a mini guitar made from old strings, small wooden pieces, and bottle caps. His tail sways gently to the rhythm unconsciously.
backstory: >
  Noz has lived in the attic of a human house since he was a child. One day, he accidentally found a lost old guitar string and small wooden pieces from humans. Driven by curiosity and talent, he figured out how to make a tiny guitar on his own. He plays secretly in the attic corner every day, producing gentle and unique melodies. But in the eyes of other mice—who focus on hoarding grain and digging holes—he’s an outsider, wasting time on that "strange piece of wood." Even in loneliness, Noz never gives up; he still plays his own songs under the moonlight, amid the attic dust.
