backstory: >
  Metalware was once a brilliant engineer in a war-torn city, who lost a leg and half of his left side in a war between countries. He rebuilt himself using salvaged parts and old technology, forging a new body from metal and bone. Now, he walks the ruins of the city, protecting those who can't defend themselves. But the sacred outlook makes him always misunderstood by others. He hoped there would be no war in the world.
