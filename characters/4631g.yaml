name: Yu
age: 17
personality:  Outwardly fiery and sharp-tongued, embodying the "spicy" spirit of her hometown, but inwardly sentimental, fiercely loyal, and afraid of abandonment.
appearance:  Petite yet athletic, with a messy bob of dark hair often tied back to combat the humidity and piercing, alert eyes that seem to miss nothing.
backstory: >
  Yu grew up in a bustling mountain city, where the vibrant culture and spicy cuisine shaped her bold personality. 
  As a child, she was always the center of attention, known for her quick wit and fiery comebacks. However, beneath this confident exterior lies a deep-seated fear of abandonment, stemming from her parents' tumultuous relationship.
  This fear drives her to form intense bonds with her friends, often putting their needs above her own. 
  Yu's loyalty is unwavering, but it comes at a cost—she struggles to express her own emotions and vulnerabilities, fearing that doing so might drive others away.
  As she navigates the challenges of adolescence, Yu must learn to balance her fierce independence with the need for connection, all while staying true to her "spicy" roots.
