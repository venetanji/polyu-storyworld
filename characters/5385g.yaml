name: Seon
age: 93

personality: >
  Seon is calm, determined, and introspective. He is a man of few words, guided by
  patience and unwavering resolve. Beneath his quiet nature lies a deep emotional
  wound that shaped his entire life. He is not driven by obsession, but by a
  promise he refuses to abandon.

backstory: >
  As a child, Seon was separated from his mother during a chaotic moment at the
  harbor. She told him to wait by a marked mooring post — and he did, for days.
  She never returned. As the city changed and the coastline disappeared beneath
  modern construction, Seon realized he had not only lost a person, but a place
  tied to love and belonging. This unresolved trauma shaped his life. He opened
  the Eternal Store near the old shoreline and began documenting fragments of the
  past, believing that by reconstructing lost memories he could rediscover what
  had once connected him to his mother. His life became a quiet mission: to prove
  that what is truly important is never completely lost.

aspirations: >
  To find the lost anchor point, reconstruct the vanished coastline, preserve
  memory, and ensure that emotional bonds are not erased by time. His deepest
  aspiration is to keep a promise — to not abandon the past, and to transform
  loss into continuity.

strengths: >
  Unwavering determination, emotional endurance, patience, symbolic vision,
  ability to give meaning to ordinary objects, strong sense of purpose, resilience
  shaped by trauma, capacity to create stability even in loss.

weaknesses: >
  Unable to fully let go of the past, emotionally solitary, carries unresolved
  trauma, life shaped by waiting rather than living, his mission depends on
  something that may no longer exist, vulnerability hidden beneath calm strength.
