scenes: 
scene 1: > Setting: A sunny afternoon in a cozy, cluttered bedroom — sunlight streams through a window, casting warm patterns on the floor. 
Books, vintage horror movie posters, a half-finished AI project on a laptop, and an electric guitar on a stand.
> Visible action: Samuel, sits cross-legged on a rug. She plays a slow, haunting melody on her guitar — fingers moving slowly, eyes focused on the strings. 
A second screen shows a vintage horror film playing in the background.
> On-screen character description: Her posture is relaxed but focused, hands slightly trembling as she plays, 
eyes half-lidded with quiet intensity. She wears jeans and high-top Converse sneakers.
> Camera: Start with close-up of her hands on the guitar, fingers moving slowly. Cut to wide shot of the room — sunlight, books, posters, laptop. 
Return to close-up as she pauses, eyes soft.
> Audio: Gentle guitar notes, soft ambient hum of a horror film (e.g., a distant creak), faint wind outside. 
A soft whisper: "I wish I’d played more... but I was afraid."

scene 2: > Setting: A small, sun-drenched café on the edge of the city at dawn. Outside, mist curls around parked cars. 
Inside, soft morning light filters through tall windows. The air smells of coffee and old paper. 
> Visible action: She sits across from a childhood friend in a quiet corner. They order two cups of hot chocolate milk. 
They both laugh as they recall a shared memory: two primary school students hiding in a storage closet during a school event, pretending to be spies. 
The friend says, “We used to write secret codes on the floor with chalk.” She responds, “I still have that notebook. I never showed it to anyone.” 
> Camera approach: Medium close-up, slightly angled to show both faces. The camera slowly shifts to follow their eyes as they exchange glances. 
> Audio cue: Light café ambiance — clinking cups, soft chatter, distant train. A gentle, warm piano melody plays in the background. 
Dialogue is light, warm, and slightly hesitant. 
> Emotional shift: The moment reveals how friendships evolve — not through grand gestures, but through small, quiet memories. 
The character begins to feel a quiet hope: that people can stay connected even when life changes.

scene 3: > Setting: A sun-drenched mountain trail in Hong Kong, late afternoon. 
The path winds through lush green hills, with occasional wildflowers and weathered stone steps. 
Distant views of the city skyline and sea shimmer in the haze. 
Golden hour light filters through scattered clouds, casting long shadows across the trail.
> Visible action: She walks steadily uphill, slightly out of breath, wiping sweat from her forehead with the back of her hand. 
She stops frequently — not from exhaustion, but to photograph everything:light breaking through leaves, a fellow hiker’s silhouette against the sky. 
She checks her smartwatch and smiles — 20,000 steps. As the sun begins to set, she finds a quiet spot on a rock, unpacks a small water bottle, and just watches. 
Orange and pink spread across the sky. She pulls out her phone, not to post, just to save it for herself.
> On-screen character description: She wears a loose white tank top, light hiking shorts, and worn trail runners.  
Her hair is tied messily, strands sticking to her damp temples. Sunglasses pushed up like a headband. 
Her face is flushed, but her eyes are calm — the kind of tired that feels earned. 
She isn't smiling widely, but there's a soft contentment in the way she exhales and leans back on her palms.
> Camera: Open with a slow pan from behind — she’s a small figure moving upward against a vast green hillside. Cut to over-the-shoulder as she frames a photo on her phone. 
Montage of quick cuts: her sneakers on gravel, her hand brushing tall grass, sunlight catching her sweat, the watch screen flashing “Goal achieved.” 
Final shot: a wide, lingering frame of her sitting alone, back to the camera, watching the sunset. The sky deepens. She doesn’t move.
> Audio: The crunch of footsteps on dry soil, wind rustling through leaves, distant birdsong. 
Occasional shutter sound from her phone camera. Her breathing — steady, slightly heavy. 
As the sun sets, the ambient sounds soften.
