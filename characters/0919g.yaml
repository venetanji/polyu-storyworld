  PvE expeditions despite his self-doubt.

    description: >
      While surveying a partially collapsed district, Lin Zhiyao
      identifies inconsistencies between official safety markers
      and real-time environmental feedback. His insistence on
      rerouting the group prevents exposure to a concealed hazard.

      During a multi-team expedition, Lin shares only verified
      navigation data, withholding uncertain segments. Another
      group encounters unexpected environmental dangers, raising
      questions about responsibility and information ethics in a
      PvE-focused world.
