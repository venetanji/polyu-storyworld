backstory: >
  Lin Heng took over the family business after his parents were left in debt and their hopes shattered. At 17, he began learning programming, using logic and code to fix broken systems — both mechanical and personal. Over time, he built a reputation for solving problems others dismissed as impossible. Now, he lives in a modest apartment, working long hours, always watching for subtle signs of failure. He trusts data over intuition, and believes every small flaw can be solved with the right algorithm.
