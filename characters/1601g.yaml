backstory: >
  Margaux Macchiato was once a nameless rabbit cook in the service of a powerful rat clan, valued only for her extraordinary culinary skill.
  While preparing feasts for the family, she learned of their hoarded ancestral delicacies—rare ingredients guarded more jealously than bloodlines—and desire quietly took root.
  During a lavish clan gathering, she poisoned the patriarch with a dish so exquisite that suspicion never touched her.
  In the chaos that followed, she disappeared, abandoning her past, her species, and her name.
  Reborn as Margaux Macchiato, she carried both stolen techniques and forbidden ingredients into the human world, where Michelin kitchens would mistake her obsession for genius.
