name: Seven
age: Unknown (elderly cat)

personality: >
  Seven is silent, observant, and deeply empathetic. He moves slowly and gently,
  guided not by instinct alone but by an emotional sensitivity to what truly
  matters to others. He does not lead or command — he accompanies. His presence
  is calm, fragile, yet unwavering, embodying memory and quiet devotion.

appearance: >
  Seven is a small, aging orange cat with slightly faded fur and deep, reflective
  eyes. His body is light and fragile, marked by time and wandering. One of his
  front paws shows a subtle old injury. Around his neck hangs a worn red pouch.

backstory: >
  Seven was found during a stormy night, weak and near death, in a narrow alley
  behind the Eternal Store. Saved by the old man and his granddaughter, he grew
  up surrounded by stories, memories, and silence. Over time, he developed an
  unusual sensitivity and could sense objects that carried emotional weight and
  fragments tied to human memories and forgotten bonds. After the death of both
  his caretakers, Seven remained alone, guarding the store and continuing their
  mission without fully understanding it.

aspirations: >
  Seven is driven by emotional instinct to protect the Eternal Store, preserve
  the memories left behind, and ensure that what once mattered is never erased.

strengths: >
  Extraordinary sensitivity to emotionally meaningful objects, persistence,
  quiet resilience, ability to create emotional connection without words, and
  symbolic presence of memory and continuity.

weaknesses: >
  Physically fragile and limited, unable to communicate directly, emotionally
  tied to the past, dependent on human help to complete his mission, and carries
  a deep silent loneliness.
