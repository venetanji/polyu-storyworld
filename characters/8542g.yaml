    title: "The First Step on Ice"
    ltx_prompt: |
      Setting: A frozen ridge known as Adelie Penguin Land at dawn, where the ice is thin and cracks underfoot. The air is cold, still, and carries a faint scent of salt and fish.  
      Visible action: Licht slides forward on the ice, one paw at a time, the sword strapped to their back and a fish bag on their side. As they move, a pair of penguins appear at the edge—quick, sharp, and ready to snatch fish from baby seals. One penguin snaps its beak shut as a seal drops a fish. Licht freezes—eyes wide, one paw still on the ice.  
      On-screen character description: Licht is a baby seal with slick black and silver fur, one eye slightly open, paws clumsy but steady. Their body language is still, alert, like a statue caught in thought.  
      Camera: Handheld, slow push-in as Licht steps forward, then a sudden shake as the penguin appears. The shot lingers on Licht’s face, then pulls back to show the ridge and the penguins in the distance.  
      Audio: A deep, rhythmic heartbeat pulses beneath the ice—steady, growing stronger. As the penguins appear, a sharp *clack* of penguin feet echoes. Then silence. A single, soft breath from the wind.

    title: "The Mirror of the Ice"
    ltx_prompt: |
      Setting: A frozen ridge at twilight, where the ice reflects the sky like a mirror. The air is still, quiet, and carries a soft breeze.  
      Visible action: Licht stands at the edge of the ice, facing a large mirror-like pool. They place a small fish in the water and watch it vanish—then place a smooth stone. The stone sinks slowly, and the surface ripples gently.  
      On-screen character description: Licht is a baby seal with slick black and silver fur, one eye slightly open, paws slightly clumsy. They stand still, eyes focused, as if listening to the ice itself.  
      Camera: Static shot of the mirror-like ice, then a slow tracking shot as Licht moves toward the pool. The camera lingers on the stone as it sinks.  
      Audio: Wind chimes in the distance. A soft, echoing *plink* as the stone sinks. Then silence. A faint, resonant hum from beneath the ice.
