backstory: 
Mochi is not an ordinary stray cat. Legend says it was born from the first beam of sunlight hitting
the white clock tower in Quanzhou on the first day of spring. Adopted by the spirits of the old colorful temple, 
Mochi was gifted a magical goldfish bell that helps guide lost souls and bring good fortune to the city.
It spends its days napping on the warm terracotta tiles of the temple roof, watching over the busy streets below. 
The floral wreath on its head changes with the seasons, seemingly blooming from Mochi's own connection to 
the earthworks and nature around the city. Locals believe that if you see Mochi showing its pink paw pads, 
you will have good luck for the rest of the year. It is the lively, kawaii mascot of the city's history and modern vibrancy.
